== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* WooCommerce 2.2 or later
* WordPress 4.4 or later

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don‚Äôt need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of WooCommerce, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type ‚ÄúWooCommerce Print Invoice‚Äù and click Search Plugins. Once you‚Äôve found the plugin you can view details about it such as the the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking ‚ÄúInstall Now‚Äù.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading the plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to prevent that the Website URL and page numbers are printed? =

You can find an option in the print window of your browser to hide those. This is a browser specific option that can't be controlled by the plugin. Please read the browser help for more information.

= Why are my bulk printed orders not splited to separate pages? =

Your browser is to old to create the page breaks correctly. Try to update it to the latest version or use another browser.

= Even though the shipping and billing address is the same, both are still shown, why? =

It depends on your WooCommerce settings. Addresses are displayed the same way as on the WooCommerce account page. Only one address is printed in case you disabled alternative shipping addresses or the whole shipping. In all other cases both addresses are shown.

= It prints the 404 page instead of the order, how to correct that? =

This is most probably due to the permalink settings. Go either to the WordPress Permalink or the WooCommerce Print Settings and save them again.

If that didn't help, go to the WooCommerce 'Accounts' settings tab and make sure that for 'My Account Page' a page is selected.  

= How do I quickly change the font of the invoice and delivery note? =

You can change the font with CSS. Use the `wcdn_head` hook and then write your own CSS code. It's best to place the code in the `functions.php` file of your theme. 

An example that changes the font and makes the addresses very large. Paste the code in the `functions.php` file of your theme:

`
function example_serif_font_and_large_address() {
	?>
		<style>	
			`#page {
				font-size: 1em;
				font-family: Georgia, serif;
			}
			
			.order-addresses address {
				font-size: 2.5em;
				line-height: 125%;
			}
		</style>
	<?php
`}
add_action( 'wcdn_head', 'example_serif_font_and_large_address', 20 );
`

= Can I hide the prices on the delivery note? =

Sure, the easiest way is to hide them with some CSS that is hooked in with `wcdn_head`.

An example that hides the whole price column and the totals. Paste the code in the `functions.php` file of your theme:

`
function example_price_free_delivery_note() {
	?>
		<style>
			.delivery-note .head-item-price,
			.delivery-note .head-price, 
			.delivery-note .product-item-price,
			.delivery-note .product-price,
			.delivery-note .order-items tfoot {
				display: none;
			}
			.delivery-note .head-name,
			.delivery-note .product-name {
				width: 50%;
			}
			.delivery-note .head-quantity,
			.delivery-note .product-quantity {
				width: 50%;
			}
			.delivery-note .order-items tbody tr:last-child {
				border-bottom: 0.24em solid black;
			}
		</style>
	<?php
}
add_action( 'wcdn_head', 'example_price_free_delivery_note', 20 );
`

= I use the receipt in my POS, can I style it? =

Sure, you can style with CSS, very much the same way as the delivery note or invoice. 

An example that hides the addresses. Paste the code in the `functions.php` file of your theme:

`
function example_address_free_receipt() {
	?>
		<style>
			.content {
				padding: 4% 6%;
			}
			.company-address,
			.order-addresses {
				display: none;
			}
			.order-info li span {
				display: inline-block;
				float: right;
			}
			.order-thanks {
				margin-left: inherit;
			}
		</style>
	<?php
}
add_action( 'wcdn_head', 'example_address_free_receipt', 20 );
`

= Is it possible to remove a field from the order info section? =

Yes, use the `wcdn_order_info_fields` filter hook. It returns all the fields as array. Unset or rearrange the values as you like.

An example that removes the 'Payment Method' field. Paste the code in the `functions.php` file of your theme:

`
function example_removed_payment_method( $fields ) {
	unset( $fields['payment_method'] );
	return $fields;
}
add_filter( 'wcdn_order_info_fields', 'example_removed_payment_method' );
`

=  How can I add some more fields to the order info section? =

Use the `wcdn_order_info_fields` filter hook. It returns all the fields as array. Read the WooCommerce documentation to learn how you get custom checkout and order fields. Tip: To get custom meta field values you will most probably need the `get_post_meta( $order->get_id(), 'your_meta_field_name', true);` function and of course the `your_meta_field_name`. 

An example that adds a 'VAT' and 'Customer Number' field to the end of the list. Paste the code in the `functions.php` file of your theme:

`
function example_custom_order_fields( $fields, $order ) {
	$new_fields = array();
		
	if( get_post_meta( $order->get_id(), 'your_meta_field_name', true ) ) {
		$new_fields['your_meta_field_name'] = array( 
			'label' => 'VAT',
			'value' => get_post_meta( $order->get_id(), 'your_meta_field_name', true )
		);
	}
	
	if( get_post_meta( $order->get_id(), 'your_meta_field_name', true ) ) {
		$new_fields['your_meta_field_name'] = array( 
			'label' => 'Customer Number',
			'value' => get_post_meta( $order->get_id(), 'your_meta_field_name', true )
		);
	}
	
	return array_merge( $fields, $new_fields );
}
add_filter( 'wcdn_order_info_fields', 'example_custom_order_fields', 10, 2 );
`

=  What about the product image, can I add it to the invoice and delivery note? =

Yes, use the `wcdn_order_item_before` action hook. It allows you to add html content before the item name.

An example that adds a 40px large product image. Paste the code in the `functions.php` file of your theme:

`
function example_product_image( $product ) {	
	if( ( '' !== $product->get_id() ) && has_post_thumbnail( $product->get_id() ) ) {
		 echo get_the_post_thumbnail( $product->get_id(), array( 40, 40 ), array( 'loading' => false ) );
	}
}
add_action( 'wcdn_order_item_before', 'example_product_image' );
`

= How can I differentiate between invoice and delivery note through CSS? =

The `body` tag contains a class that specifies the template type. The class can be `invoice` or `delivery-note`. You can prefix your style rules to only target one template. For example you could rise the font size for the addresses on the right side:

`
.invoice .billing-address {
	font-size: 2em;
}

.delivery-note .shipping-address {
	font-size: 2em;
}
`

= How do I customize the look of the invoice and delivery note? =

You can use the techniques from the questions above. Or you consider the `wcdn_head` hook to enqueue your own stylesheet. Or for full control, copy the file `style.css` from `woocommerce-delivery-notes/templates/print-order` to `yourtheme/woocommerce/print-order` and start editing it. 

Note: Create the `woocommerce` and `print-order` folders if they do not exist. This way your changes won't be overridden on plugin updates.

= I would like to move the logo to the bottom, put the products between the shipping and billing address and rotate it by 90 degrees, how can I do that? =

Well, first try it with CSS and some filter/action hooks, maybe the questions above can help you. If this isn't enough, you are free to edit the HTML and CSS of the template. Consider this solution only, if you really know some HTML, CSS and PHP! Most probably you want to edit the `print-content.php` and `style.css`. Copy the files from `woocommerce-delivery-notes/templates/print-order` to `yourtheme/woocommerce/print-order` and start editing them. 

Note: Create the `woocommerce` and `print-order` folders if they do not exists. This way your changes won't be overridden on plugin updates.

= Is there a list of all action and filter hooks? =

Unfortunately there isn't yet. But you can look directly at the template files to see what is available. 

= Which template functions are available? =

You can use the functions from WordPress, WooCommerce and every installed plugin or activated theme. You can find all plugin specific functions in the `wcdn-template-functions.php` file. In addition the `$order`variable in the template is just a normal `WC_Order` instance. 

= Can I download the order as PDF instead of printing it out? =

No, this isn't possible. Look for another plugin that can do this.

= I need some more content on the order, how can I add it? =

The plugin uses the exact same content as WooCommerce. If the content isn't available in WooCommerce, then it will neither be in the delivery note and invoice. In case you have some special needs, you first have to enhance WooCommerce to solve your issue. Afterwards you can integrate the solution into the invoice and delivery note template via hooks.

= How can I translate the plugin? =

Upload your language file to `/wp-content/languages/plugins/` (create this folder if it doesn't exist). WordPress will then load the language. Make sure you use the same locale as in your configuration and the correct plugin locale i.e. `woocommerce-delivery-notes-it_IT.mo/.po`. 

Please [contribute your translation](https://github.com/TycheSoftwares/woocommerce-delivery-notes#translating) to include it in the distribution.
